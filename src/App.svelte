		Of course, numbers aren't the same thing as people's lived experience; they can only tell part of the story. </p>
	<p>

		However, they show that women today still have a delicate balancing act between married life and work if they choose both.

			<strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/census2020/census-2020">2020 Census of Population</a>
			by Department of Statistics Singapore
		</p>
		<p>
			The first dataviz looks at the breakdown of employed residents by sex from three different angles: first, the employed in the aggregate, then those within the highest income bracket, and finally, those who within the bracket who
			have never been married (the census definition of "single" status).
		</p>
		<p>
			The second dataviz looks at the breakdown of unemployed residents by their main reason for not working, focusing on one demographic at a time: women in general, married women, and married men.
			As the census samples residents aged 15 years old and above, the singles demographic includes residents of schooling age. Unsurprisingly, education/training is this segment's main reason for not working, whether men or women, and this aspect is
			not shown in the story.
